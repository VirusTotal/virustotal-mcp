# Client configuration fragments

These fragments configure the VirusTotal MCP server: seven common tools with the compatible VTAI 0.8 backend, plus local stdio `submit_local_file` for eight. Common tools are the four report lookups, `get_analysis`, `submit_file` and `get_submission`. Remote HTTP never exposes the local-path tool. Choose **stdio or HTTP** for a client, merge the selected entry into its existing configuration, and preserve unrelated servers. Do not replace an entire settings file with a fragment.

The [versioned configuration directory](https://github.com/king-tero/vt-mcp/tree/v0.8.0/examples/client-configs) contains the fragments shipped in the `v0.8.0` source distribution. This branch also includes later recipes, which are not added retroactively to published archives. The wheel does not install fragments as client settings. Check [client validation levels](../../docs/clients.md) before choosing a setup.

The corporate source at [VirusTotal/virustotal-mcp](https://github.com/VirusTotal/virustotal-mcp) is currently private preparation. The linked public v0.8.0 source and release remain under king-tero until the distribution moves; the package name and VTAI endpoint do not change. See [discovery status](../../docs/discovery.md).

Additional recipes reviewed on 2026-09-12, with their own evidence:

| File | Client / destination | Validation scope |
|---|---|---|
| [cursor-http.json](cursor-http.json) | Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or project `.cursor/mcp.json` | CLI header expansion and discovery verified locally; IDE, tool calls and model/VTAI workflow pending |
| [vscode-http.json](vscode-http.json) | VS Code `.vscode/mcp.json` or **MCP: Open User Configuration** | Native HTTP calls and restart verified locally; [scope and model/VTAI limits](../../docs/clients.md#additional-client-validation) |
| [copilot-cli-stdio.json](copilot-cli-stdio.json) | Copilot CLI `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` | CLI 1.0.83 completed a domain lookup with a model through public vt-mcp 0.8.0 and VTAI; other tool workflows unverified |
| [stdio.json](stdio.json) | Devin CLI v3000.3 / Local 3.6 onward, `~/.config/devin/mcp_config.json` | CLI 3000.10.21 initialized the wrapper through ACP/stdio; this configuration file, tool discovery and model/VTAI workflow remain unverified |
| [cascade-http.json](cascade-http.json) | Cascade → **MCP Servers** → raw configuration file | Open the path selected by your app version; token-file expansion, transport and native workflow pending |

The [setup guide](../../docs/clients.md#cursor) explains restart, discovery and
removal. Do not copy VS Code's `servers`/`inputs` format into Copilot CLI's
`mcpServers` file. Devin Local and Cascade also have separate recipes.

Cascade's documented legacy path is `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`; Devin
Desktop 3.10.23 on Linux opened `~/.config/devin/mcp_config.json`. Use its **MCP
Servers** action to open the correct file for your version, merge the fragment
and refresh. Preserve existing settings and avoid adding the server twice.

For stdio, install the verified wheel first. `vt-mcp` must be on the PATH used by the host; otherwise replace it with the absolute path reported by `command -v vt-mcp`. The token path is an example. vt-mcp expands `~` itself; no shell expansion of arbitrary JSON values is assumed. Declare `VTAI_TOKEN_FILE` explicitly, especially in Gemini, which filters sensitive inherited environment names. Gemini CLI no longer serves Code Assist individual, Google AI Pro or Ultra accounts through Google login; use [Antigravity CLI (`agy`)](../../docs/clients.md#antigravity-cli-agy) for those accounts.

For HTTP, no vt-mcp or Python installation is required. The earlier HTTP fragments use **`x-apikey`**; Cursor, VS Code and Cascade recipes use **`Authorization: Bearer`**. VTAI 0.8.1 accepts either with the same VTAI token; use only one header. Credential references are interpreted by each host: an environment variable for Cursor, a password input for VS Code's Extension Host, and a protected file for Cascade. This is static token authentication, not OAuth. Never replace a reference in these files with the credential itself. Load environment variables outside chat using the [access guide](../../docs/access.md#remote-client-environment). The [client guide](../../docs/clients.md#bearer-authentication-validation) documents the Bearer alternatives for earlier clients.

With v0.7.0, Antigravity CLI (`agy`), Claude Code and Codex completed the five tools at the transport levels above. See the [native-client evidence](../../docs/client-validation-2026-09-07.md) for the same selected analysis, agy's auxiliary output-file read and protocol limits. This does not validate other hosts or a different installed artifact. For an authorized test deployment, replace the URL with that deployment's exact `/mcp` URL and prefix. The REST base ending `/api/v3` is not the MCP endpoint.

OpenCode has separate [V1](https://opencode.ai/docs/mcp-servers/) and [V2](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/mcp-servers) layouts. On 2026-09-06, the [public schema](https://opencode.ai/config.json) accepted V1 `mcp.<name>` but rejected the documented V2 `mcp.servers.<name>`. These fragments target V1 only. Pin and test a V2 binary before translating them; changing the name of this file does not establish V2 support.

No HTTP fragment is provided for Antigravity or Kimi. agy 1.1.27 sent `$VAR`, `${VAR}` and `${env:VAR}` header references literally in a local discovery test. Safe header expansion remains unestablished for the reviewed Antigravity IDE and Kimi versions. Use the shared stdio fragment. No bridge package or provider-specific MCP server is needed.

## Specific permissions for autonomous tasks

[agy-permissions.json](agy-permissions.json) lists the eight local 0.8 tools. Merge
only its `permissions.allow` entries into
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, preserving other settings and existing
deny/ask rules. Omit `submit_file` and `submit_local_file` for a read-only setup.
The fragment contains no credential and does not authorize arbitrary file disclosure.

Claude Code uses the seven exact `mcp__virustotal__...` grants in the
[client guide](../../docs/clients.md#claude-code); append
`mcp__virustotal__submit_local_file` only for stdio. Codex uses the same server entry
and its normal host policy for the specific tool names. Do not substitute broad
permission bypasses. Host policies and native login remain separate from VTAI.
The [0.8 submission-workflow evidence](../../docs/clients.md#version-08-submission-evidence)
records the native sessions, asynchronous results and separate public SDK checks.
The historical 0.7 configuration evidence above keeps its recorded scope.
