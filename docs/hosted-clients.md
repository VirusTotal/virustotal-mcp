# Hosted ChatGPT and Claude connections

The tested client guides remain [Agy](clients.md#antigravity-cli-agy),
[Claude Code](clients.md#claude-code), then [Codex](clients.md#codex-cli--remote-http).
This page covers separate hosted connections. ChatGPT setup and validation were
updated on 2026-09-24; the Claude setup review remains dated 2026-09-08.
The [validation scope](#validation-scope) records the verified ChatGPT connection,
IP reports and automatic renewal, earlier staging checks and remaining hosted workflows.

VTAI's public endpoint is `https://ai.virustotal.com/mcp`. It supports MCP OAuth
and also accepts a static VTAI Agent Token through one credential header,
including `Authorization: Bearer`. The service's ten common tools cover four report
lookups, file and URL submission, domain/IP reanalysis, and receipt and analysis
reads. Protected-resource and authorization-server metadata, DCR and CIMD are
live. A backend with the ChatGPT attachment binding additionally exposes
`submit_chatgpt_file`. Local stdio instead adds `submit_local_file`; remote HTTP
cannot read local paths. A successful CLI session does not establish a different
hosted account or model workflow.

## File transfer depends on the host

When the client can supply the actual bytes, use `submit_file` with their SHA-256
and base64 content. Remote HTTP does not by itself prevent file transfer, and an
attachment in chat does not by itself prove that the host can access its bytes.

### ChatGPT attachments

When the deployed backend advertises `submit_chatgpt_file`, ChatGPT can supply
an attached file through its [file-input contract](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/reference#define-file-inputs).
The tool accepts one `file` object with required `download_url` and `file_id`
strings and optional `mime_type` and `file_name` strings. ChatGPT supplies these
values; do not invent a URL or paste credentials. The metadata
`openai/fileParams: ["file"]` identifies this input to the host.

The backend downloads an allowed host-provided attachment with bounded time and
size (24,000,000 bytes), hashes its original bytes and uses the existing file
submission permission and receipt flow. A successful response supplies the
SHA256 for `get_submission`; use its registered analysis ID with `get_analysis`.
Never replay an uncertain upload. If interrupted before receiving its SHA256,
do not invent a receipt or retry to find out whether it was sent.

VTAI verifies the attachment's bytes and checks its hash before uploading. Only a
confirmed unknown file is uploaded, without consuming query quota. A known file
is not uploaded; returning its existing report consumes one query and is denied
when quota is exhausted. Owned receipt recovery costs no query, while report and
analysis reads count on every call. See [file workflow quota](analysis.md#query-quota-for-file-workflows).

Standard sharing and sensitive-content permission still apply. A supplied
`file_name` is checked against the same short credential-name list as the Claude
plugin. It is optional, unverified metadata, not proof of the real filename or
file contents. Do not omit or rename it, encode bytes or change upload channels
to evade a denial.

This is a hosted-only capability; stdio does not expose the tool. If it is absent,
refresh the connection's tool inventory after the backend deployment. These
instructions and protocol tests do not establish an end-to-end ChatGPT attachment
test or availability in every account.

### Existing web fallback

If the client cannot transmit those bytes, first calculate the file's SHA-256
locally, or ask the user for it, and call `get_file_report(hash)`. Use an existing
report without uploading. Only a confirmed missing report permits offering the
existing [VirusTotal upload page](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).
Permission, quota or service errors do not establish absence. Standard
uploads are not confidential and share content with the security community and
partners. Ask before sharing the user's own documents, internal code, credentials
or personal data, including sensitive content inside an attachment or unfamiliar
file. This alternative does not bypass host permissions or quota errors.

After the user uploads the confirmed unknown file through the website, use
`get_file_report(hash)` with the same hash. The report may not be available yet. Web uploads do not
create VTAI receipts or register analysis IDs: do not use `get_submission` or
`get_analysis` for that external upload. Every report query consumes
quota, including missing reports and cache hits; keep later reads within a finite
task budget. See [file transfer and recovery](analysis.md#when-the-client-cannot-transmit-file-bytes).

## Claude organization request-header beta

**Status: documented setup for eligible organizations; not tested in Claude.**
Anthropic restricts Request headers to selected organizations. If the field is
absent, this route is unavailable in that account. The organization deliberately
shares one VTAI identity, including its quotas and submission ownership; this
is suitable only when that shared access is intended. Individual identities
require the OAuth route below.

1. Obtain an organization-owned VTAI token using the [access guide](access.md).
   Keep a protected copy for revocation. Use neither another user's token nor a
   development/CI credential.
2. In the organization's custom-connector dialog, enter the endpoint above and
   choose **Authentication: None**. This selects the host's non-OAuth mode;
   VTAI still authenticates every request.
3. Under **Request headers**, add required **Authorization** with the complete
   value `Bearer ` followed by the token. Enter it only in that credential field.
   Do not add `x-apikey` or OAuth to this connection.
4. Enable the connector in a conversation and run the acceptance query below.
   If authentication settings need changing later, remove and recreate the
   connector; removing it alone does not revoke VTAI access.

These steps follow [Anthropic's request-header documentation](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/remote-mcp#authenticating-with-request-headers).
Host permissions still govern tool execution. Configure them for the intended
operations; the server's submission tools do not add a per-call confirmation
argument. The host may request confirmation independently.

## ChatGPT public connection and individual OAuth

**Status: initial OAuth consent, MCP IP reports and automatic token renewal verified in ChatGPT Work on 2026-09-24.**
Revocation from the hosted application, incremental authorization and write
workflows remain unverified. Claude hosted acceptance is separate and remains unverified.

### Connect ChatGPT Work

Use an account and workspace that permit Developer mode. Enable it under
**Settings → Security and login → Developer mode** if needed. Availability
depends on the account and workspace policy.

1. In **Plugins**, use **+** to create a plugin/application named **VirusTotal**
   with the MCP endpoint **`https://ai.virustotal.com/mcp`**. Choose **OAuth**;
   leave optional Client ID and Client secret fields blank for automatic
   negotiation. Reuse an existing application configured with that endpoint.
2. Open the plugin's linked application and check **Connected accounts**.
   Creating the application alone may not connect your account. If necessary,
   choose **Connect** or **Connect another account**, sign in, review the
   permissions and select **Allow access**.
3. Install the personal plugin if it is not already installed, then start a
   **new Work chat**. Type **@**, select **VirusTotal**, and request an explicit
   MCP lookup:

   > Use the VirusTotal MCP tool get_ip_report for 8.8.8.8. Explain the report's
   > source, analysis date and coverage.

Confirm that the conversation contains the MCP tool result. An answer based on
browsing the public VirusTotal website, including a message about JavaScript,
does not establish that MCP was used. If the application has no connected account
or tools, complete the account connection, refresh its tools and start a new
chat. Keep a working account connection; a new Agent Token is not needed for OAuth.

This is a personal Developer mode setup, not a claim of availability in ChatGPT's
public directory. See OpenAI's [connection guide](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt)
and [Work chat quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/quickstart).

### OAuth compatibility

ChatGPT's authenticated public MCP connection uses OAuth. A static VTAI token
cannot be entered as an OAuth client secret. Its authorization contract includes
PKCE S256, protected-resource and issuer discovery, and resource-bound access
tokens. CIMD or a pre-registered client can avoid dynamic client registration.
[OpenAI authentication](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/auth).

VTAI uses a maintained authorization provider and validates issuer, resource,
expiry, approved scopes and active grants before applying its access controls,
quotas and receipt ownership. The resource is `https://ai.virustotal.com/mcp`,
and the issuer is `https://ai.virustotal.com`. Clients can discover these through
[protected-resource metadata](https://ai.virustotal.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp)
and [authorization-server metadata](https://ai.virustotal.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server).
The advertised registration endpoint supports DCR, and discovery advertises
Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD) support. Configure the MCP URL without static
headers for OAuth and follow the host's sign-in and consent flow. Support for
these protocols does not by itself establish compatibility with a hosted account.

**CIMD authentication negotiation:** ChatGPT's current client metadata offers
`none` and `private_key_jwt` in `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`, alongside
a legacy singular preference for `private_key_jwt`. VTAI OAuth **0.10.2 or later** can select `none` when a
CIMD document explicitly offers it, using mandatory PKCE S256. This does not add
JWT client authentication: a client requiring only `private_key_jwt` remains
unsupported. DCR continues to support `none`, `client_secret_basic` and
`client_secret_post`. Public-client negotiation does not change redirect checks,
resource binding, approved scopes or grant revocation.
Check the deployed version at [`/oauth/health`](https://ai.virustotal.com/oauth/health).
With an earlier server version, select DCR where the host offers it.
[OpenAI's negotiation rules](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/auth).
The ChatGPT consent, report and renewal checks below exercised a real hosted
connection. Protocol negotiation alone does not validate its remaining workflows.

For report and receipt reads, request `vt:reports:read`. File submission additionally
requires `vt:submissions:write`; URL submission and domain/IP reanalysis require
`vt:network-analysis:write` instead. Both write permissions require reports-read.
Existing connections do not gain the new network scope through token refresh:
reconnect and approve it when needed. Consent applies to the connection without
a VTAI confirmation on every operation; the host's tool permissions still apply.

Claude also supports OAuth for individual accounts. Use the exact callback and
registration mode documented for the chosen host; a client secret and DCR are
not universal requirements. [Claude authentication](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/authentication).

For private ChatGPT testing, OpenAI also offers Secure MCP Tunnel with stdio or
HTTP. It requires Platform tunnel permissions, a runtime API credential and the
correct ChatGPT workspace association. It does not replace the authenticated
public endpoint required for plugin distribution. No tunnel is provisioned or
validated by this project. [Secure MCP Tunnel](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/secure-mcp-tunnels).

## Validation scope

On 2026-09-24, a ChatGPT Work application completed personal browser consent
against production and returned an IP report through MCP. The same connection
later renewed its token automatically and returned another IP report after the
previous access token had expired, without another consent step. Report requests
linked to the same OAuth connection and refresh-state transitions corroborated
these operations. This verifies initial hosted authorization, report reads and
automatic renewal for that connection. It does not verify revocation from the
hosted application, incremental authorization, write workflows or public-directory
distribution. The account connection was retained for continued use.

On 2026-09-14, a native Codex browser login and domain report succeeded in staging.
These were direct client calls, not model conversations or a hosted ChatGPT test.
On 2026-09-15, an owned Smithery hosted connection completed CIMD authorization
and consent, discovered the then-current seven tools and returned one domain
report in staging. The check used the documented Smithery Connect API alias with
a pinned CLI adaptation; it does not certify the unmodified CLI. A later call was
denied after grant revocation, but its access token had already expired, so that
observation does not prove immediate rejection of an unexpired token.

Those staged flows establish their stated operations, not a hosted production
login, every tool or a commercial-model workflow. They predate the new network
tools and permission. The later ChatGPT result above has its own limited scope;
Claude hosted account and model workflows remain unverified.

## First hosted acceptance query

For an initial read-only check, enable only `get_domain_report` in the host's
tool permissions where available. In a new conversation, ask:

> Use VirusTotal to get the domain report for example.com. Explain the source,
> analysis date and coverage. Do not submit a file or start an analysis.

Accept the connection only after observing the actual tool call and its result,
not just a Connected label or an assistant's prose. Record the host/account
mode, discovered tools, call name, domain, outcome, report link, source,
analysis date, retrieval time and coverage. Exclude the credential and private
conversation content from evidence. Use the connection's discovered tool list;
the local-file tool is available only through stdio.

A missing report remains unknown; errors and incomplete coverage are not safety
verdicts. A passing query does not validate file or network submission, refresh, revocation,
other tools or publication in a host's directory. Test those as separate flows.
For temporary testing, remove the connector and revoke its access: use
[Your connections](https://ai.virustotal.com/oauth/connections) for OAuth, or the
[access guide](access.md#revoke-access) for a static Agent Token.

For OAuth acceptance, verify receipt isolation between identities, rejection of
expired or revoked access, and refresh preserving the same VTAI identity. A
submission test must use intentionally public inert bytes and recover its
original receipt without repeating an ambiguous upload. For an authorized network
operation, persist a lowercase UUIDv4 before dispatch and recover with
`get_submission(request_id=request_id)` through the same connection. Read
`get_analysis(analysis_id, request_id=request_id)` within a finite polling budget.
See [network analysis and recovery](analysis.md#network-analysis-and-recovery).
